Imagine a single server handling many reQuest from Different Clients.
Imagine a store keeper serving many customers in a shop. That shop attendant is suppose to attend to every body so ,
Assume that He is attending to every one and then some of the customers are requesting for thing he would have to search for 
or items that have not yet been opened or freshly delievered good that are yet to be priced, then that customer would have to wait or hold on  , 
for Him to finsh attending to other people after he finishes then he will later go an look for the item for the customer who is on hold. 

That is the case of Async programming holding a proecess to complete another thing and later coming back to complete the main process.
